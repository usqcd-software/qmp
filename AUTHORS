QMP Authors
===========

Main developers are Jie Chen <chen@jlab.org>, Robert Edwards <edwards@jlab.org>
and Chip Watson <watson@jlab.org>, all at Jefferson Lab.  This software
is part of the National Computational Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory
(http://www.lqcd.org/) so other members of the Software Committee
made significant contributions to the QMP API design.

Incorporation of autoconf and automake into the build system was done
by Balint Joo <bj@ph.ed.ac.uk> and George Fleming <flemingg@jlab.org>.

Update to API version 2 and addition of single node target was done by
James Osborn (josborn at physics.bu.edu).
